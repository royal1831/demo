REPORT ON SDLC, WATERFALL and AGILE METHODOLOGIES
Software Development Life Cycle:
SDLC is a process for Planning, Creating, Testing and Deploying a system. Planning: In this stage, we define the requirements of the new project and determine the cost, resources and fix goal for the project. We will analyze the risks involved and prepare a overview to overcome the risks.
Build: In this stage, we create what we want we build code from scratch that is required according to the requirements of the project.
Testing: In this stage, we test the code we build whether it is working or there are any flaws in the code and we fix the issues raised until the requirements of the project are fulfilled.
Deploy:  After completing all the stages we reach the deployment stage here we deploy what we got and we monitor clearly is this exactly matches the client requirements from the feedback given by the client we make changes accordingly.
WATERFALL MODEL VS AGILE
Waterfall Model: 
As this process is sequential, once a step has been completed, developers canâ€™t go back to a previous step without scratching the whole project and starting from the beginning. There is no room for change or error, so a project outcome and an extensive plan must be set in the beginning and then followed carefully.
Agile Model:
The agile method can provide more flexibility during project development. This method does not require a rigid, sequential framework. Instead, it begins with basic project design, but no outline work to follow. In this model, we can simultaneously work in each stage and if any changes occur in any stage we can change and reflect the changes in all the stages simultaneously and meet the requirements of the client in given time.
